# duaIterateMix
A Multiclass simulation-based traffic assignment model for mixed traffic flow of connected and autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles. duaIterateMix.py is a traffic assignment tool, which helps you to solve the traffic assignment problem in the mix traffic condition (mix flow of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs)). This tool is based on the duaIterate.py (https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/tree/main/tools/assign) from SUMO and will be added to the SUMO repository soon.

Instruction:
1- The travel demand file should be split into two parts (CAVs and HDVs) by DemandGenerator.py
2- open a terminal and run duaiterateMix.py with the new demand files which are generated in the previous step

An example is available in this repository

You should first install SUMO on your machine to be able to use this tool! more info: https://sumo.dlr.de/

Warning: This tool be be added to SUMO repository soon!
