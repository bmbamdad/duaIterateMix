1- name your trip file as "trips.xml"
2- determine CAVs and HDVs options (penetration rate of CAVs, CAVs rerouting probability, etc.) 
3- Run the DemandGenerator.py in order to split your trips file into trips.trips.xml (for HDVs) and trips.trips.CAV.xml (for CAVs) 

Here is an example command line for running DemandGenetor.py: 

python CAVDemandGenerator.py --CAV-Percentage 80 -CAV trips.trips.CAV.xml -CAVRePe 60 -CAVRePr 0.1 -CAVReDe true  -HDV trips.trips.xml -HDVRePe 90 -HDVRePr 0.5 -HDVReDe true

in this example the penetration rate of CAVs is 80%; CAVs rerouting period= 60 sec; CAVs rerouting probability=10%; CAVs have deterministic rerouting; HDVs rerouting period=90; HDVs rerouting probability=0.5; HDVs have determinist rerouting
