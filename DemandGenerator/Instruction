1- name your trip file as "trips.xml"
2- determine CAVs and HDVs options (penetration rate of CAVs, CAVs rerouting probability, etc.) 
3- Run the DemandGeneratorMeso.py or DemandGeneratorMicro.py (based on hte scale of your simulation) to split your trips file into trips.trips.xml (for HDVs) and trips.trips.CAV.xml (for CAVs) 

Here is an example command line for running DemandGenetor.py: 

python DemandGeneratorMeso.py --CAV-Percentage 40 -CAV trips.trips.CAV.xml -CAVRePe 120 -CAVRePr 0.4 -CAVReDe true  -HDV trips.trips.xml

In this example the penetration rate of CAVs is 40%; CAVs rerouting period= 60 sec; CAVs rerouting probability=10%; CAVs have deterministic rerouting; HDVs dont have rerouting device
